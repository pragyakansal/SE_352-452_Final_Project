# SE_352-452_Final_Project
Welcome to our Real Estate Management System, which we built using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, MySQL, and Spring Security.

- To run our project, use this command: mvn spring-boot:run from the terminal or run it from your IDE.
- You will need to update the database credentials (username and password) in application.properties to reflect the username and password you have set for MySQL on your machine.
- Once the application is running, go to your browser and visit http://localhost:8080/landing-page to use the application.
